# Kessler

Kessler Syndrome is a theoretical scenario in which the density on objects in low earth orbit becomes so high that an collision can set off a chain reaction that produces more collisions endlessly.

In the game, you are a ship floating in orbit and you have to survive as long as possible and try to shoot down as many asteroids as possible. Controls are just like classic 'Asteroids' , but all objects follow orbital motion which makes maneuvering much harder!

Inspired by Asteroids, Kerbal Space Program and Bubble Struggle.
